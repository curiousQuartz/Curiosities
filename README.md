# Welcome to my Developer Portfolio

This repository was created as a place to keep my small code projects.
Each folder in this repository will be its own independent project.
This can be anything from coding challenges to my own unique ideas.

## Project Descriptions

### Cradle

Cradle is a script created near the beginning of my Visual Effects journey. The challenge was to create an animated Newton's cradle from scratch using the built in scripting language for Autodesk Maya.

### Paws N' Cart

Paws n' Cart is a challenge I was given and took an interest in. When it was first introduced to me, it was aimed at python students which had only started to learn the langauge and so had little foundation yet. This led to it being explained as a challenge to do by manipulating strings only since other data-types were not taught to the students yet. I took an interest in this and decided to do the challange in a few parts, each focusing on a data type to see how that might change the code and what is possible.
