# Paws n Cart

Paws n Cart, the best online shopping cart for your furry friends.

## Important

Each python file is a different version of this program and can be run independently.

This program requires python 3.10 or later to run
due to the use of match-case statments which were
not introduced until this version.

## Challenge

Challenge Goal: Use only a single string to store lists of information instead of lists.
                This includes information like the items in the cart and price of items.

Bonus Goal: Create a version focusing on lists and a version focusing on class objects.

Challenge Description:
    Create a shopping cart program which allows a user to:
        1. Add and remove items from the cart
        2. View the price of the cart items
        3. Clear the cart
        4. Generate a random shopping cart
        5. Modify quantity of items

This code was created by me but the idea for the challenge is not mine.
